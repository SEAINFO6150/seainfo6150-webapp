      <h1> &nbsp; The Statue of Liberty's torch heads to new museum </h1>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statue of Liberty's original torch is getting a new home.</p>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating from the weather and was replaced by a replica 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in 1984. It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since. </p>

      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Liberty Island in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved," says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;torch, "it is certainly the most important."</p>

      <h1>&nbsp; The history of the Statue of Liberty </h1>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a UNESCO World Heritage site under the designation of 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Outstanding Universal Value.</i> </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel -- 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence -- although, 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland formally unveiled her in 1886.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States as immigrants 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;via neighboring Ellis Island.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy," says John 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. That symbolic spirit inspired the decision to inscribe these 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;famous lines on the statue's pedestal: </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me your tired, your poor 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." </p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2017, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symbolism both in the US and around the world.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower 
          <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manhattan, including the World Trade Center.</p>
